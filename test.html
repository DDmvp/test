            Minimize code duplication
            Keeping code DRY and maintainable is one of the biggest challenges in software development, and that applies
            to
            CSS as well. In practice, one big
            component of maintainable code is minimizing the amount of edits necessary to make a change. When values
            depend
            on each other, try to reflect their relationship in the code.

            On Responsive Web Design
            The common practice is testing a website in multiple resolutions and adding more and more media queries to
            fix the issues that arise. However, every media query adds overhead to future CSS changes, and they should
            not be added lightly. Here are a few more tips to avoid needless media queries: Use percentages or
            viewport-relative units instead of fixed widths. When you want a fixed width for larger resolutions, use
            max-width, not width. When using multi-column text, specify column-width instead of column-count, so that
            you get one column only in small resolutions.

            shorthands wisely
            You could of course try to set all the longhands and call it a day, but then you might forget some. Or the
            CSS WG might introduce more long- hands in the future, and your code will have failed to reset those. Donâ€™t
            be afraid of shorthands. It is good defensive coding and future-proofing to use them, unless we
            intentionally want to use cascaded properties for everything else.
